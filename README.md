# CSCI_2275_Final
Final project for CSCI 2275 

Our plan is to use a graph to model the CU campus, making notable locations nodes and the walking distance between them weights. With the graph, we plan on making a pathfinding application capable of guiding the user from one location to the other in the shortest distance. We plan on using multiple types of pathfinding algorithms so the user can find paths that contain certain node types, get cardinal directions and more. Along with the graph we also plan on using a stack to store directions/nodes, tracing the path back to the starting node, so the user can click through/pop the stack to get the next direction, similar to the google maps assistant be it a little more manual.

----------------------------------------

Our project will:

  #Have a modeled graph of the CU campus
  
  #Give step by step directions from loction to location untill the destination is reached
  
  #Create an optimal path to the destination based on the data we have
	
	
	
----------------------------------------
  
Other interesting potential features:

  #Give cardinal directions between loctions (North, East, South, West), as we could add x anf y courdinates to the nodes
  
  #Give an eta based on mode of transportaion (walking, skateboarding, biking, ect.)
  
  #Give a description of the location, as a stored string in the node
